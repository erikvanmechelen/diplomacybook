**Who am I?** 

I first played Diplomacy at age 15 in 2002. It was a face-to-face game hosted by my history teacher. After winning as Germany, I started a Diplomacy Club which took over our school. Today, I'm a council member of the MN Diplomacy Club and stream online games on Twitch. 

Keeping up this resource and additional strategy material at [Diplo Strategy](https://diplostrategy.com) is hard work.
