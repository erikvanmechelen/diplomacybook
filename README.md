## Dare to be Dangerous

My name is Erik and I'll be your guide on this Diplomacy journey. Whether you are a new player entering your first few games face-to-face or online, or simply hoping to step up your game to an intermediate level, you've come to the right place!

#### Who am I?

I first played Diplomacy at age 15 in 2002, a face-to-face game hosted by my history teacher. After winning as Germany, I started a Diplomacy Club which took over our school. Today, I'm a council member of the MN Diplomacy Club and stream online games on Twitch. I expect to play at least two face-to-face tournaments in 2020, including the World Diplomacy Championships.

Creating and maintaining this free strategy resource and additional strategy material at [Diplo Strategy](https://diplostrategy.com) is hard work. So why am I even doing this? Simple. **I believe Diplomacy is one of the best--if not *the* best--board game ever created.** It's not going anywhere. As a ritual of several of our most important survival toolkits--communication, competition, collaboration--it is second to no other game. I want you to enjoy your first game and your 50th game. My wish is for us to be on the same tournament board, for you to stab me, and then tell me you learned how because of my work.

## Where to Play <a name="Play"></a>

My favorite way to play is face-to-face, in club games, or, better, in a multi-game tournament. Why? Because there is a level of commitment that players who take a car, train, or plane to show up at a game have made, which will make it more likely they will be strong opponents. For me, capable competent opponents are preferred to undedicated Diplomacy dabblers.

## The Rules <a name="Rules"></a>

Here is [PDF of the rulebook](https://www.wizards.com/avalonhill/rules/diplomacy.pdf) from the version of the game I own. 

[This page on WikiBooks](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Diplomacy/Rules) is useful too.

## Scoring Systems <a name="Scoring"></a>

Brandon Fogel's discussion of [the Janus Scoring System](https://github.com/erikvanmechelen/diplomacybook/blob/master/2019-07%20-%20Systems%20of%20Value%20in%20Diplomacy%20(Janus)%20v3%20(1).pdf) provides a brief history of scoring systems and advocates for the upcoming Janus approach.

Under what winning and draw conditions a game is played greatly affects the individual strategies and approaches the players take on.

## Opening Theory <a name="Opening_Theory"></a>

To my way of thinking, the choice of Opening should depend on information gathered from other players and support a near-term strategy consistent with that information and your own goals. Maybe you need to counter the expected opening of your neighbor. Maybe you want to position your units so as to better collaborate with your desired ally. You donâ€™t choose your opening; the opening chooses you.

For more on Opening Theory, try Richard Sharp's [The Game of Diplomacy](http://www.diplomacy-archive.com/god.htm) or see my own views for each Great Power in this stylized book, [Diplomacy: Conversations with Barbosa](https://leanpub.com/diplomacy/).

Here's an excerpt:

PHILOSOPHY

Frederico fancied discussions about Diplomacy as much as anyone. Sometimes he preferred them to playing the game itself.  

What is the fundamental nature of Diplomacy?, he asked me prior to our only ever game together.  

For me, Diplomacy is a 7-player game about area control guided by secret and simultaneous piece movement. The player who most effectively manages and strategically expands his territory wins or takes part in a draw. If we advance the discussion to include game theory, all good strategies include one thing: effective negotiation. In a word, Diplomacy.  

Mr. Barbosa didn't mind this description, though he had his quibbles.  

He who can influence his opponents to collaborate at the right moments and misdirect them in others improves his drawing and winning chances. The game was a ritual, he argued, which had comparisons to Machiavellian political philosophy as well as to notions of realpolitik present in the era contemporary to the starting positions of the game: 1901.

## Stealing Your Destiny

Diplomacy is far far more than ensuring you get your orders in on time. 

But to give too much away--and believe me, I'm trying--is also double-edge, because it takes away some of the fun of making your own mistakes and discovering new ways that the old guard didn't see. 

This gives you a chance to try new things, like ordering `A Lvp H` (!) for diplomatic reasons.
